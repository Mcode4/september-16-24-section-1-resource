# Week 3 Practice Assessment

This is a practice assessment for Week 3. The purpose of this assessment is to
simulate the environment of your assessment on Monday.

We recommend that you take this practice assessment as many times as it takes
for you to get 100% of the points passing in half the real assessment time. This
will prepare you to take the real assessment in a timed environment.

Your first score for this assessment is a good indicator of how you would do on
the real assessment without practicing further.

For the real assessment, you may use the following resources:

* [MDN]

  * Or can be a physical whiteboard or paper, but must be fully within your
