      Rest parameter is used to concatenate all the arguments of a function into one array. Spread operator is used to spread the values of a data type.

    <example-answer>
      The rest parameter and spread operators are both represented by three dots
      (...) in front of a variable.

      The rest parameter is used when concatenating all the parameters of a
      function into one array. This is useful for functions that don't have a
      set number of parameters defined.

      The rest operator is used when spreading the elements of a data type out.
      You can spread the elements of an array into another array. You can spread
      the key-value pairs of an object into another object. You can also spread
      the elements of an array or the characters of a string into separate
      arguments to a function call.

      Students should have all of the following:
      * The spread operator and rest parameters are represented by three dots
        (...) in front of a variable
      * The spread operator spreads the values of an object or an array
      * The rest parameter is used to concatenate the arguments of a function
        into a single array
      * At least one of the spread operator usages:
        * Spread the elements of an array into another array
        * Spread the elements of an array or the characters of a string into
          separate arguments to a function call
        * Spread the key-value pairs of an object into another object
